Multiplayer Snake Game. This game was created in 15 hours during HTML 5 Game Jam 
on 9.10.2010 - 10.10.2010 October in Hilversum, the Netherlands.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Snakes is based on simple concept of usual Snake games. The main
difference is that Snakes is a multiplayer game and therefore
allows interaction between players. Thanks to the HTML 5 and
CSS 3 technology, various 3D effects are present.
